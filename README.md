# Economic_relevance_usingNLP

This kernel aims to give a brief overview of performing text classification using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree Classifier. We will be using a dataset called "Economic news article tone and relevance" which consists of approximately 8000 news articles, which were tagged as relevant or not relevant to the US Economy. Our goal in this kernel is to explore the process of training and testing text classifiers for this dataset.
